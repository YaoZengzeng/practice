    ## Pod anti-affinity can prevent the scheduler from placing Prometheus replicas on the same node.
    ## The default value "soft" means that the scheduler should *prefer* to not schedule two replica pods onto the same node but no guarantee is provided.
    ## The value "hard" means that the scheduler is *required* to not schedule two replica pods onto the same node.
    ## The value "" will disable pod anti-affinity so that no anti-affinity rules will be configured.
